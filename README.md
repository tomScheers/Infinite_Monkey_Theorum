# Infinite Monkey Theorum
This is a Python script, which is inspired by the famous Infinite Monkey Theorum, which states that if you let a monkey type random characters on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, evventually it will have written the entire works of Shakespeare!
Now my Python script doesn't have enough time to do that, but it is possible for it to search for some small words, and with small, I mean small. A 5 letter word would already take a few minutes on average, because this is Python.

# About
This project utilises a random number generator to get a random char out of a selection of characters, which it then appends to the text and then it will look if it matches the input word, if not, go on.
